                <h4>Everything From Scratch</h4>
                <p>My primary goal for this project was to develop a game as from-scratch as possible. 
                    To that end, I wrote a simple game engine to support my development, 
                    with features like input handling, sprite sheets, and a collision system.
                    On top of this engine, I programmed the game, implementing all gameplay features and UI myself.
                    I also created all of the game's art, audio and game design.

                <h4>UI For Every User</h4>
                <p>
                    One of my core goals for this game was to ensure that players could navigate its menus using their preferred method of input.
                    To that end, its menus were specially designed to be navigable using gamepad, keyboard, and mouse.
                    To achieve this functionality, I designed the input system with generic input events 
                    that would trigger if any buttons in a specified set of keys, mouse buttons and controller buttons were pressed, held, or released.
                    Menu widgets such as volume sliders were specially designed to accept both 
                    step movement from arrow keys and smooth movement from a click-and-drag input.
