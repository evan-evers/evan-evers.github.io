                <h4>Everything From Scratch</h4>
                <p>My primary goal for this project was to develop a game as from-scratch as possible. 
                    To that end, I wrote a simple game engine to support my development, 
                    with features like input handling, sprite sheets, and a collision system.
                    On top of this engine, I programmed the game, implementing all gameplay features and UI myself.
                    I also handled all of the game's art, audio and game design.

                <h4>UI For Every User</h4>
                <p>
                    Crate Buster features from-scratch UI widgets that can be navigated with gamepad, keyboard and mouse.
                    UI was not originally intended to be a major focus of this project,
                    but I ended up having so much fun putting together the widget system that I put a lot of time into making it nice.
