                    A program for analyzing large quantites of text data quickly using multithreaded algorithms.

                <h3>Highlights:</h3>
                <h4>Multiple Algorithmic Approaches</h4>
                <p>
                    This program includes three text-parsing algorithms: "single_thread", "multi_thread_1", and "multi_thread_2".
                    "single_thread" is included as a baseline for comparing the speed of the multithreaded algorithms.
                    "multi_thread_1" splits its analysis tasks into different threads.
                    In my testing, I found it to be nearly identical in speed to "single_thread".
                    This is because one of the tasks takes up the vast majority of the algorithm's time.
                    "multi_thread_2" runs "single_thread" on multiple files in parallel.
                    This algorithm significantly outperforms the other 2, and can take greater advantage of multiple cores.
                </p>
                <h4>General-Purpose Text Interpretation</h4>
                <p>
                    One of this project's core features is tokenizing and parsing user text commands. 
                    For this project, I decided to develop a general-purpose text interpreter that I could reuse for future command-line programs.
                    The interpreter works in 2 stages.
                    First, it breaks commands into tokens.
                    Second, it analyzes those tokens, and if they're valid, the interpreter calls the associated command function. 
                    Additional parameters will also be passed into the called command function if the parameters are expected and valid.
