                    A program for analyzing large quantites of text data quickly using multithreaded algorithms.

                <h3>Highlights:</h3>
                <h4>Multiple Algorithmic Approaches</h4>
                <p>
                    This program includes three text-parsing algorithms: "single_thread", "multi_thread_1", and "multi_thread_2".
                    "single_thread" is included as a baseline for comparing the speed of the multithreaded algorithms.
                    "multi_thread_1" splits its analysis tasks into different threads.
                    In my testing, I found it to be nearly identical in speed to "single_thread".
                    This is because one of the tasks takes up the vast majority of the algorithm's time.
                    "multi_thread_2" runs "single_thread" on multiple files in parallel.
                    This algorithm significantly outperforms the other 2, and can take greater advantage of multiple cores.
                </p>
                <h4>General-Purpose Text Interpretation</h4>
                <p>
                    One of this project's core features is tokenizing and parsing user commands on the command line.
                    While it wasn't the focus of this project, 
                    I decided to develop a proper text interpreter for this project that I could reuse for future command-line projects.
                    The interpreter works in 2 stages.
                    First, it breaks commands into tokens.
                    Second, it analyzes those tokens, and if they're valid, executes the associated command. 
                    Additional parameters are also passed into the command, if they're expected and valid.
