                <h3>Highlighted contributions:</h3>
                <h4>Planning and implementing core architecture</h4>
                <p>I developed the core architecture for this game myself, according to specifications given by
                    my team's game designers. This architecture includes functionality for turn order; player phase order; 
                    decks, hands, and fielded cards; interfaces to allow both human and AI players to draw, play, and field cards;
                    and win and lose states.

                <h4>Implementing custom card functionality</h4>
                <p>This game features a large number of cards with unique behavior. I developed several systems to
                    handle this. 
                    <br><br>
                    I developed functionality for cards to apply bonuses to themselves depending on what other cards had been played.

                    <br><br>
                    I developed a prompt system that halts gameplay when a player's fielded card requires another card to be selected.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    To make implementing custom behavior easy for scripters, I
                    developed a versatile Blueprint API for custom effects such as destroying
                    cards, transferring cards between players, and activating cards immediately.</p>
                <h4>Assisting with scripting and UI</h4>
                <p>I assisted with Blueprint scripting and developed some UI elements. 
                    My biggest contributions to the UI were messages that rise from cards after a card is activated, 
                    and the central text prompt that fades in whenever the human player must choose a card.
