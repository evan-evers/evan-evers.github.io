                <h4>Planning and implementing core architecture</h4>
                <p>I developed the core architecture for this game myself, according to specifications given by
                    my team's game designers. There are two core elements to the game: the Game Manager and Players. The
                    Game Manager handles player turn order, game phase, and other various pieces of game state. Player
                    objects play turns when prompted by the game manager. The core Player class is abstract and is
                    subclassed into PlayerAI and PlayerHuman to handle differences in functionality. Both the Manager
                    and Player objects have several Card Collection Components, which are multipurpose components that
                    can act as decks, hands, and a player's fielded cards.

                <h4>Implementing custom card functionality</h4>
                <p>This game features a large number of cards with unique behavior. I developed several systems to
                    handle this. 
                    <br><br>
                    I developed functionality for cards to apply bonuses to themselves depending on what other cards had been played.
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="DemoImg" src="ALIRGameplay4.gif" alt="Gameplay of At Least I'm Rich.">
                    <br><br>
                    I developed a prompt system that halts a player's turn when one of their cards requires another card to be selected.
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="DemoImg" src="ALIRGameplay5.gif" alt="Gameplay of At Least I'm Rich.">
                    <br><br>
                    To make implementing custom behavior easy for scripters, I
                    developed a versatile Blueprint API for custom effects such as destroying
                    cards, transferring cards between players, and activating cards immediately.</p>
                <h4>Assisting with scripting and UI</h4>
                <p>I assisted with Blueprint scripting and developed some UI elements. 
                    My biggest contributions to the UI were messages that rise from cards after a card is activated, 
                    and the central text prompt that fades in whenever the human player must choose a card.
