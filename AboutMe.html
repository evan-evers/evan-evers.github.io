                    <p> I'm Evan Evers, a software developer with a passion for game programming. 
                        I love helping people bring their ideas to life.
                        I'm deeply committed to lifelong learning, and have supplemented my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a wide variety of projects.

                        I recently finished an internship with <a href="https://www.indiecade.com/" target="_blank">IndieCade</a>, an organization which supports independent game development.
                        Over 5 weeks, me and a team of interns put together <a href="ProjectALIR.html" target="_blank">a game</a> for IndieCade's <a href="https://www.indiecade.com/climate-jam/" target="_blank">Climate Jam 2024</a>.
                        As the team's only C++ programmer, I developed all core functionality for the game, as well as assisting with UI and frontend.
                        Our project was ranked "Best Overall" out of 48 entries.
                    </p>

                        Last year, I completed a Bachelor's in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.biola.edu/" target="_blank">Biola University</a>.
                        I graduated Cum Laude as a First Gen student, and was privileged to serve as the founding President of Biola's Computer Science Club.

                        When I'm not coding, I'm usually practicing piano, guitar, and bass guitar. 
                        I'm a huge nerd about video games and music, and I love to hike.
